 1. Project 1: Monthly Sales for Coffee Shop SQL
The very first project I tried from Khan Academy's "Intro to SQL: Design a Store Database." I was exposed to the fundamental cocepts of SQL and database design in the context of a home maded store database. Through this project, I learned how to create a simple database schema while thinking about columns and rows (structures). 

 2. Project 2: Furniture Store Sales
This project was also provided from Kham Academy's "Intro to SQL: Data Dig." This project I learned to fundamentals of finding the minimum, maximum, averages of different values. In addition to the aggregated functions and values in SQL, I tried to find insights and trends among the data that was given.

 3. Project 3: Netflix Analytics (SQL Fiddle)
 This project was to learn SQL Fiddle, a free online browser platform. This project explored PostgreSQL instead of the MYSQL dialect. Then I was able to my inquiries about some of Netflix's shows and films.

 4. Project 4: Customer & Order Analytics
This project is to start learning SQL on the program SQLite Studio. I was given a database, BIT.db, and I learned to extract information and answer given questions. 
 
 5. Project 5: Spotify SQL Analysis
For this project, I downloaded a -.cvs file from Kaggle. This project was a little unusual where I have to establish questions myself and make inquiries on that. Although it was a litte more difficule, I was to show as much information I was able to think of.

 6. Project 6: Digital Media Store
This is the final project from the BreakIntoTech Bootcamp. I was given a database with a complicated schema. I performed different data analysis peering into different areas of the business such as: sales, employees, inventory, etc. Since this is the final project for learning SQL, there is a huge amount of questions and information I looked into.
