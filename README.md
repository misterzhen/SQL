#### **SQL Projects Portfolio**

Welcome to my SQL Projects Portfolio! This repository showcases my skills and expertise in SQL (Structured Query Language) through a collection of diverse and engaging projects, queries, and scripts. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in working with databases and my ability to extract valuable insights from data.

## **Projects:**

**Project 1: Monthly Sales for Coffee Shop SQL**

This project was my first attempt at applying SQL concepts from Khan Academy's "Intro to SQL: Design a Store Database." It provided an excellent introduction to SQL and database design by working on a simple home-made store database. I learned how to create a well-structured database schema while considering essential column and row structures.

**Project 2: Furniture Store Sales**

From Khan Academy's "Intro to SQL: Data Dig," this project focused on learning the fundamentals of finding minimum, maximum, and average values using SQL's aggregated functions. Additionally, I explored the data to identify insights and trends, gaining valuable experience in data analysis.

**Project 3: Netflix Analytics (SQL Fiddle)**

This project aimed to familiarize myself with SQL Fiddle, a free online browser platform. I ventured into using PostgreSQL instead of the MySQL dialect and applied my queries to analyze some of Netflix's shows and films.

**Project 4: Customer & Order Analytics**

In this project, I began learning SQL on the program SQLite Studio. Given the BIT.db database, I honed my skills in extracting information and answering specific questions related to customer data and order metrics.

**Project 5: Spotify SQL Analysis**

For this unique project, I downloaded a .csv file from Kaggle and took the initiative to formulate my own questions for analysis. I explored various aspects of the data related to Spotify, allowing me to demonstrate creativity in my SQL inquiries.

**Project 6: Digital Media Store**

As the final project from the BreakIntoTech Bootcamp, this was an advanced undertaking with a complex database schema. I conducted extensive data analysis covering different aspects of the business, including sales, employees, and inventory. This comprehensive project pushed me to explore numerous SQL techniques and tackle a diverse range of questions.

Feel free to explore these projects and witness my journey of continuous learning and growth in SQL.

Thank you for visiting my SQL Projects Portfolio. I hope these projects reflect my passion for SQL and its applications in data analysis. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy querying! ðŸ“ŠðŸš€
